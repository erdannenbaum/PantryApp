# PantryApp
iphone app for pantry and grocery tracking

Pantry
This is a personal project I've taken on to practice my swift skills and application design principles.
There are three main pages:
1. Your pantry, when you bought items and when they expire
2. Your grocery list, what you want and how much
3. r/recipes browsing- this section is prime for potential expansion

Getting Started
Download the application (as well as xcode) and open pantry.xcodeproj. You can run this on a simulator 
or a phone that's plugged into the computer

Built With
Swift
XCode
